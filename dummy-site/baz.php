Here is what urban dictionary has to say about baz:
</p>

<pre>
    baz 	
	
    A common name for a variable used in programming examples or exercises. It 
    ranks third in popularity after "foo" and "bar", respectively. In fact, it 
    is generally only used when a third variable is needed for the exercise (i.e. 
    foo and bar have already been used).
    
      An exercise in pointers:
      int foo;
      int * bar = &foo;
      int ** baz = &bar;

      // (*baz == bar) now evaluates to true
</pre>

Terribly exciting, right?
